## Functional Tasks
1. The system shall look like a regular calculator. [MediumPriority]
2. The system shall only have four buttons for numbers: 0, 1, 2, and 3. 	[HighPriority]
3. The system can do operations with two numbers like below. [HighPriority] 
     - The user shall enter a quaternary number, then press an operation button, then enter another number, finally pressing the 'equal' button shall display the result of the \
     operation. 
     - These operations shall be addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
4. The system shall work on only integer values. [MediumPriority]
5. The system can do operations with one number like below. [LowPriority] 
     - The user shall enter a quaternary number, then pressing an operation button shall display the result of the operation. 
     - These operations shall be square and square-root.
6. The system shall have a visible display for the entered numbers and the result of the operation. [HighPriority]
7. The display shall view the number both in quaternary and in decimal by using a toggle button. [MediumPriority]

## Non-Functional
1. The system shall be implemented in IntelliJ Idea and JDK >=12.
2. UI and logic should be separate.
	- The logic part should be unit-tested!
4. The system shall have a gitignore file to ignore the temporary files.
6. One of the team members shall create a repository and add others as collaborators.
